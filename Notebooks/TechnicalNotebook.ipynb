    "#### For this project, I am trying to show that various MLB team stats for a season can be used to predict how many games that team won that season. I theorize that this should be possible due to the amount of stats that are collected for each team each season, and the fact that virtually everything that has an impact on the outcome of a game is recorded statistically somewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### I used data from baseball reference. For each season, I took 3 tables, one with misc team stats, one with pitching stats, and one with batting stats. I combines all of the stats into one data frame, dropping columns that were not needed, and adding two of my own metrics for each stat, the League Average Difference (LA/D) and the Rank. I then used the backward selection method to fit the model, starting with all the columns and then removing them one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The resulting model has 97.9% of explained variance, and comes within at least 6.32 games of predicting win totals from the testing data, with an average difference of .1 wins per prediction. The average difference being close to 0 is a good sign, and the max difference in predicted and actual wins is 4%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In conclusion, I think it is safe to say that this model shows that it is absolutely possible to use team stats from a season to predict how many wins the team won that season. This model is not bad at all, but it could be better. For one, there are so many stats that are collected for baseball, and some of them are not easily available. For another, the model assumes that there are no interaction effects between any of the predictors. The sport is incredibly complex, so it is very possible that some or all of the predictors have an interaction effect with some or all of the other predictors, and one that is difficult to spot. A final concern is that this model by itself cannot be used to predict the future, as it needs stats to be put up in order to predict how many wins a team with those stats should have. However, if combined with a model that predicts player stats for an upcoming season, this model could still be used to predict the win total of a team in a future season. In short, while this model might not be as good as it could possibly be, it is good enough to show that stats can be used to predict wins."
